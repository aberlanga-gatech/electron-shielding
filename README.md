# electron-shielding
Simple code that implements recursion to calculate details about the electrostatic character of an element based on what I learned from CHEM 1310.

If you are trying to do complex shielding calculations, this program is not for you. 
I made this because I was *supposed* to be studying for my 3rd midterm for CHEM 1310. (I coded this while "studying")
I got a 95% on that test. You be the judge if this helped me study.

I did not realize I was using recursion until it was fully implemented. My bad(?).

Anyhow, this is not really a readme; the details are all in the file comments. I hope you like it.
